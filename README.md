**Objective**

To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

**What I've learned while working on the project** 
- What is JavaScript?
- JavaScript Basics
- JavaScript Functions
- DOM Interaction
- API's, Ajax & Asynchronous Behavior
- Complex UI Elements with JavaScript
- Introduction to jQery
- Bootstrap & UI Libraries
- Performance & Debugging

**The 5 W's**
- **Who?** My professional network, as well as potential employers.
- **What?** A JavaScript app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which uses an
external API (https://pokeapi.co).
- **When?** Immediately! The code for the app can always be viewed in a repository like
GitHub or GitLab.
- **Where?** Potential employers, clients, and collaborators might look at the code
directly from my GitHub repository or be directed to my GitHub profile from my
portfolio site.
- **Why?** For my potential employers, clients, and collaborators to see how I create
the architecture of a JavaScript app, as well as how I test and debug my code.

**Key Features**
- Load data from an external source (API)
- View a list of items
- On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item

**Technical Requirements**
- The app must load data from an external API.
- The app must display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
- The app must enable the viewing of more details for a given list item on demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
- The app must have CSS styling.
- The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint rules.
- The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier.
- The JavaScript code may be manually formatted.
- The app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or touch interactions.
- The app must not throw any errors when being used.
- The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages.
- The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.
